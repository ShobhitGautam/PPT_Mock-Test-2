1)Static Position:
The static position is the default position for HTML elements. Elements with static position are positioned based on the normal flow of the document.
html - 
<div class="static">Static Position</div>
css-
.static {
  position: static;
}
2)Fixed Position-
The fixed position is positioned relative to the viewport. The element remains fixed in its position even when the page is scrolled.
html -
<div class="fixed">Fixed Position</div>
css-
.fixed {
  position: fixed;
  top: 20px;
  right: 20px;
}
3)Sticky Position:
The sticky position is a mix of relative and fixed positions. It behaves like a relative position until the element reaches a specified threshold, and then it becomes fixed.
html -
<div class="sticky">Sticky Position</div>
css -
.sticky {
  position: sticky;
  top: 20px;
}
4)Relative Position:
The relative position is positioned relative to its normal position. It allows you to adjust an element's position using the top, right, bottom, and left properties.
html-
<div class="relative">Relative Position</div>
css -
.relative {
  position: relative;
  left: 50px;
  top: 20px;
}
5)Absolute Position:
The absolute position is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor. If no positioned ancestor is found, it is positioned relative to the initial containing block.
html -
<div class="container">
  <div class="absolute">Absolute Position</div>
</div>
css -
.container {
  position: relative;
  height: 200px;
}

.absolute {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
